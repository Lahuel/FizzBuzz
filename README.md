# FizzBuzz Refactoring Kata

## FizzBuzz Challenge

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.

But for the multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number

and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


## Meeting a new Requirement

Then here comes a new requirement to handle,

such that if a number is

- a multiple of seven, print "Bazz"

- a multiple of three and seven, print "FizzBazz"

- a multiple of five and seven, print "BuzzBazz"

- a multiple of three, five, and seven, print "FizzBuzzBazz"
